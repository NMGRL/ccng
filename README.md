Common Core Noble Gas. A data standardization for noble gas data, specifically Ar-Ar

The purpose of this project is to describe and mantain a standardized data specification for noble gas data, especially for Ar-Ar.  The specification can be implemeneted used various backends, such as XML, JSON, and YAMl. (JSON is currently the prefered backend). A standardization is necessary if the Noble Gas/Ar-Ar community ever hopes to efficiently share data among laboratories using different data collection and data processing techniques.
